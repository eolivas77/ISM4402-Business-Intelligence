This is a central repository to the exercises in the e-book Learning Data Analysis with Python. The files starting with "Assignment " contain the portion of the exercises that are called "Your Turn" in the book. The file named "Book Exercises" Includes all exercises within the workbook inclusive of the "Your Turn" exercises which I will re-type everything as I go along. This will help me practice my typing and will also help me to follow along with the text and reference pages in the text much easier. Feel free to use this these notebooks to help you if you're stuck in a particular excercise
